    <div class="textSection2 text-justify">
        <p>Some of the key takeaways are</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Sector and Industry Perspective</p>
        <p>Data is really important in today's world. Companies rely a lot on data to make decisions and understand transaction behaviour through numbers. Data plays an important part in marketing and in understanding the company’s needs. Companies are realizing customer importance and are spending a lot on data based on customer spending and buying behaviour. People are becoming more and more conscious regarding the environment because of the content they are consuming which is creating more awareness related to their planet. The two types of sustainability were also highlighted, the first one being eco sustainability which talks about how companies can protect the environment and business sustainability which talks about how companies have to survive by focusing on generating profits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textSection2 text-justify">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Company’s Perspective</p>
        <p>Many companies are redefining marketing strategies to adopt AI in their day-to-day business process. AI adoption in companies will lead to unassisted business growth in many business segments of companies. Brand storytelling plays an important role for companies to connect with customers. For example, for many people, the first house is an emotion and when they take a loan from HDFC, it shows their trust in the HDFC brand for this emotion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="textSection2 text-justify">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Thematic Discussion</p>
        <p>Technology is at a constant stage of evolution and marketers need to be updated regarding the same and its implementation in their respective fields. Metaverse is a very revolutionary concept and it will cause many disruptions. But it is still very far fetched as there is no proper infrastructure or ecosystem for the users like no good internet speed and connectivity. If a proper ecosystem is created for the Metaverse many people will adopt the concept and will provide significant revenue to the companies. Measuring the ROI of marketing innovation is crucial. For companies to understand and increase their ROI it is very important for them to understand their KPIs and increase their team productivity.</p>
