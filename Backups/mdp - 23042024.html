            – A New Perspective .”</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Dr. Chirag Shah was the resource person for the program. The session
            started with inauguration by the CEO – CIMR, Dr. Madhumita Patil, and Director - CIMR, Dr. Nandita Mishra.
            11 participants had attended the program.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">During the 8 hours session, Dr. Chirag Shah gave a new perspective toward
            the derivatives as a financial instrument. He elaborated on the use of derivatives as a risk management
            instrument. At the same time he emphasised on the right use of leverage for wealth creation.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The participants were happy to learn that Derivatives can be used as a long
            term investing tool rather than just a speculative tool with a zero sum game. They appreciated the way Dr.
            Chirag Shah cleared all the concepts without diving too much in the technicalities and by keeping things
            simple.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">At the end of the session, the participants were more confident to use the
            financial instruments for their personal wealth management. They also gave their qualitative feedback to the
            CEO about the session.</p>

            domain. Program was aiming to focus on the standard and best project management practices for your
            cybersecurity projects which can help your organization learn from mistakes, avoid similar mistakes in the
            future and facilitate the continuous improvement of processes, procedures and projects. Properly documenting
            cybersecurity project specifics will save time and resources for similar projects in the future, while
            allowing teams to collaborate while keeping their communications secure thereby reducing the risk of a
            crippling data breach.</p>

            to build a functional, secure base of IT infrastructure while keeping an eye on project resources, time and
            manpower to ensure that projects stay under budget. By breaking down cybersecurity initiatives into more
            manageable chunks with shorter life cycles, business and IT leaders can produce results without having to
            recreate the wheel with every initiative.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">This two-day program (4 hours per day) aims to help participants develop a
