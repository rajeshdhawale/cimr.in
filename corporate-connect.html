                <h2>SUMMER PLACEMENT</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify"><span class="heading1">SIP -</span> Summer placement (Summer internship
            programme, i.e., now popularly known as SIP), is an integral part of the academic curriculum of PGDM. For
            the successful completion of the programme, the students are required to complete the SIP.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">After completion of the 1st year of the programme, i.e., after the 2nd
            semester and before the commencement of the second year of the programme, the students are required to work
            with an organisation for hands on experience. The duration of the SIP is eight to ten weeks. In some cases
            this period may be a little longer.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">SIP aims at widening the student's perspective by providing an exposure to
            real life organisational and environmental situations. This will enable the students to explore an
            industry/organisation, build a relationship with a prospective employer, or simply hone their skills in a
            familiar field. SIP also provides invaluable knowledge and networking experience to the students. During the
            internship, the student has the chance to put whatever he/she learned in the 1st year of PGDM into practice
            while working on a business plan or trying out a new industry, job function or organisation. The
            organisation, in turn, benefits from the objective and unbiased perspective the student provides based on
            concepts and skills imbibed in the first year at the institute</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Some ideal projects for summer internships can be in the areas of strategy
            formulation, business process reengineering, MIS, ERP implementation, retail banking, industry analysis, new
            product launches, sales and distribution, market research and advertising, etc., among others. However, this
            is not an exhaustive list of areas but can be varied to suit the requirements of the organisations where the
            student has to undergo internship. In some cases, even field work can also become an integral part of SIP.
            An additional benefit that organisations may derive is the unique opportunity to evaluate the student from a
            long-term perspective. Thus the SIP can become a gateway for final placement of the student.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The student should ensure that the data and other information used in the
            study are obtained with the permission of the organization concerned. The students should also behave
            ethically and honestly with the organisation.</p>

        <p class="textSection2 text-justify pt-3 pt-md-4">On Saturday, 27th August, 2022 Chetana’s Institute of
            Management and Research conducted a Management Development Program on the topic, “Investing with Derivatives
            – A New Perspective .”</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Dr. Chirag Shah was the resource person for the program. The session
            started with inauguration by the CEO – CIMR, Dr. Madhumita Patil, and Director - CIMR, Dr. Nandita Mishra.
            11 participants had attended the program.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">During the 8 hours session, Dr. Chirag Shah gave a new perspective toward
            the derivatives as a financial instrument. He elaborated on the use of derivatives as a risk management
            instrument. At the same time he emphasised on the right use of leverage for wealth creation.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The participants were happy to learn that Derivatives can be used as a long
            term investing tool rather than just a speculative tool with a zero sum game. They appreciated the way Dr.
            Chirag Shah cleared all the concepts without diving too much in the technicalities and by keeping things
            simple.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">At the end of the session, the participants were more confident to use the
            financial instruments for their personal wealth management. They also gave their qualitative feedback to the
            CEO about the session.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The session ended with the certificate distribution by CEO ma’am to all the

Program was aiming to focus on the standard and best project management practices for your cybersecurity projects which can help your organization learn from mistakes, avoid similar mistakes in the future and facilitate the continuous improvement of processes, procedures and projects. Properly documenting cybersecurity project specifics will save time and resources for similar projects in the future, while allowing teams to collaborate while keeping their communications secure thereby reducing the risk of a crippling data breach.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Project management allows information security (InfoSec) teams the ability to build a functional, secure base of IT infrastructure while keeping an eye on project resources, time and manpower to ensure that projects stay under budget. By breaking down cybersecurity initiatives into more manageable chunks with shorter life cycles, business and IT leaders can produce results without having to recreate the wheel with every initiative.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">This two-day program (4 hours per day) aims to help participants develop a basic framework to plan, execute, monitor and control during various phases of the projects and to apply some project management techniques for the optimal utilization of resources in the domain.</p>
