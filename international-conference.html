        Conference Overview
      </p>
      <p class="textSection2 text-justify">
        The role of technology in transforming business and society has become increasingly critical, offering unprecedented opportunities to drive innovation, enhance efficiency, and unlock new possibilities across all sectors. New age technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), advanced robotics, Internet of Things (IOT), new age reality, block chain and machine learning allow organizations to streamline operations, reduce human error, and lower costs significantly. The influence of technology extends far beyond business, reshaping industries like healthcare and education, making essential services more accessible and efficient. Digital communication platforms have revolutionized the way companies interact with customers, partners, and employees. Digital tools have helped businesses break geographical boundaries, foster communication and collaboration and provide businesses with direct channels to consumers, empower individuals and communities and promoting inclusivity.
      </p>
      <p class="textSection2 text-justify">
        The ability to gather, analyze, and act on vast amounts of data has transformed decision-making processes in business. Big data, advanced analytics, and AI-driven insights enable organizations to make data-informed, strategic choices that optimize supply chains, predict consumer behavior, and refine product development. Governments and NGOs are also leveraging data to better understand public needs, improve urban planning, and craft policies for a more sustainable and equitable society. In addition, technology’s disruption of traditional industries is driving economic growth, creating new job opportunities, and delivering more personalized services to individuals. Similarly, Fintech innovations have made the growth of financial services inclusive, thereby serving the previously unbanked populations.  
      </p>
      <p class="textSection2 text-justify">
        Increasing focus on green business such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, and sustainable manufacturing practices allow businesses to reduce their environmental footprint while still achieving growth. This shift towards sustainability has become a strategic necessity as both consumers and regulators increasingly demand greener practices.
      </p>
      <p class="textSection2 text-justify">
        Businesses are also investing heavily in technology-driven learning platforms to reskill and upskill their workforce and maintain a competitive edge. E-learning platforms, virtual training programs, and AI-assisted personalized learning solutions ensure that employees are well-prepared to meet future industry demands. At the same time, technology is democratizing education, making it more accessible through online platforms like MOOCs, virtual classrooms, and educational apps. This helps bridge the global skills gap, address job displacement due to automation, and offer new opportunities for individuals regardless of their geographic location.
      </p>
      <p class="textSection2 text-justify">
        However, as technology becomes more deeply embedded in business and society, managing technology raises complex ethical challenges. Issues such as cyber security, data privacy and the ethical use of AI are increasingly becoming critical. Responsible management of technology is crucial for maintaining public trust and ensuring that innovation benefits society. Additionally, the societal impacts of technology, such as the risks of data security breaches, misinformation, and the widening digital divide, must be addressed. Mitigating these risks is essential to ensure that the benefits of technology are shared and that it serves to uplift rather than exacerbate social and economic inequalities.

        Conference Purpose
      </p>
      <p class="textSection2 text-justify">
        The purpose of the CIMR’s International Research Conference is to create a collaborative platform for scholars, industry experts, and policymakers to engage in meaningful dialogue on the profound impact of technology on business practices and societal structures. In an era where technological advancements are driving innovation at an unprecedented pace, this conference aims to highlight both the opportunities and challenges associated with these developments. It seeks to encourage interdisciplinary research and knowledge exchange that will enable participants to explore how emerging technologies can be effectively managed to transform industries, improve decision-making, and enhance public services.
      </p>
      <p class="textSection2 text-justify">
        Harnessing the management of technology involves not just embracing its innovations but also ensuring that its deployment is aligned with the broader goals of sustainable and inclusive growth for business and society. Technology can empower people, drive economic progress, and solve some of the world’s most pressing problems if implemented responsibly. By embedding ethical considerations into the design, implementation, and management of technology, it is possible to safeguard the rights and well-being of individuals and society at large.

    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The first panel discussion was conducted online on the topic- 'Innovation-The
      Roadmap for Business Resilience'. The discussion threw light on how Innovation has taken centre-stage and is
      building resilience in businesses. We had four international speakers for this discussion. Ms. Anuprita Bhomick,
      Head of Customer Experience, Google Devices and Services, Singapore, higlighted that 'loyalty and advocacy is
      resilience'. Dr. Gerard Athaide (A proud Alumnus of Chetana's) Prof.Marketing – Loyola University Maryland,
      presented his case on how 'innovation acts as a source and impetus for building resilience'. Dr. Elina Naydenova,
      CEO and Founder, Feebris, UK emphasised that the frameworks for development through Artificial Intelligence are
      indeed strategies for resilience. Mr. George Abraham, Chairman and MD, GA Group, Singapore moderated the
      discussion and added different perspectives to the discussion.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The second panel discussion was held offline on the topic-'Business Resilience
      through Agility and Technology'. The session was very engaging and quite enriching. Mr. Lalit Popli, COO, ARCON,
      spoke about ‘Learning to Upskill’, and how Technology alone doesn't make us resilient, 'making decisions at the
      right time' does. Mr. Mahesh Rathod, CEO, BeLocal Consulting LLP, threw light on the importance of Networking and
      Relations in today's business world through his insights on how ‘Resilience is nothing but Courage’. Mr. Chandan
      Agarwal, CMI PDC Director, South Asia, National CMI Director, Sri Lanka at Unilever, rightly pointed out ‘If you
      resist change you will perish’.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The moderator of the panel, Mr. Vikaas Sachdeva (A proud Alumnus of Chetana's)
      CEO, Emkay Investment Managers Limited added, ‘Don't underestimate the power of luck, but be fearless’.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">We thank our high-spirited CEO of CRKIMR and CIMR Dr.Madhumita Patil,
      charismatic director CRKIMR Dr.Kalim Khan and energetic Director of CIMR Dr.Nandita Mishra along with the faculty
      members and non-teaching staff for ensuring that the conference was a grand success and a knowledge fest!</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Overall, it was a very enthusiastic, interest-driven, and enriching opportunity
      for our students. At Chetana’s we don’t miss any chance to help our students grow and acquire new skills and learn
      more about the industry to become better future leaders and we promise to keep it going.</p>

    <p class="textSection2 text-justify pt-3 pt-md-4">While everyone got comfortable with online classes, there was a
      need for an intellectual learning mechanism to groom the students and keep them thinking in a virtually oriented
      environment.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The international conference at Chetana was the perfect opportunity to
      encourage the students to participate, present, digitally witness and learn about not just one but four different
      areas of expertise. The discussions and learnings of the conference mainly revolved around “Harnessing India's
      Resources to make India Self-Reliant in collaboration with ASEAN countries".</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The conference began with the address of our Guest of Honour, Prof. CH. Ibohal
      Meitei followed by the keynote address by Mr. K. V. Rao from Singapore who deliberated on India’s capability to
      achieve self-reliance and in collaboration with other countries. We were honoured by the presence of Mr. George
      Abraham, from Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI), as our Chief Guest.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">For our Supply Chain conclave, we had great speakers like Dr. Chalong Suktong,
      Mr. Khin Maung Soe, Mr. Ishantor Sobhapandit, and Mr. Krishan K. Batra. There was a thorough discussion on the
      “India-ASEAN Connectivity & Global Value chain”. The leaders spoke at length with our students about Myanmar’s
      preference towards China for trade, possibilities of enhancing cultural ties, the impact of trade agreements on
      the financial markets of the countries, etc.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The ASEAN summit was graced by the presence of six distinguished speakers like
      Mr. George Abraham, Mr. Laldinkim Sailo, Mr. Lourembam Bikram, IAS Dr. Sriparna Baruah, Mr. Dato Ramesh Kodamal,
      and Prof. CH. Ibohal Meitei. Discussions on Organic farming and export potential of the North-Eastern states, land
      road projects under construction, potentials of Bamboo cultivation in the North East, and how improved
      connectivity can be brought about by highways and digital gateways, were discussed. It kept our students
      engrossed, waiting for more.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The Agri-Business and Pharmaceutical Conclave imbibed great enthusiasm and
      courage in our students to think in terms of a self-reliant Agriculture and Pharmaceutical base in India. Dr.
      Devesh Roy and Dr. Phadke addressed the trade deficit situation in our country, the presence of an innovative
      eco-system, and agribusiness start-ups. Mr. Koustubh Kanade, Mr. Mudda, Mr. Deborshi Moitra, and Mr. Daara Patel
      spoke at length about nutraceuticals and immunity, government regulations and norms, and vaccinations.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Overall, it was a very enthusiastic, interest-driven, and enriching opportunity
      for our students. At Chetana’s we don’t miss any chance to help our students grow and acquire new skills and learn

    <p class="textSection2 text-justify"><span class="heading1">International Water Conference – A Water Secure World: A
        Report</span></p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Chetana’s Institutes of Management and Research hosted a day-long international
      conference on a water secure world on the campus, on January 18, 2020. The event provided a forum for researchers
      and practitioners in the field to share ideas and research.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The event was inaugurated by Dr Madhumita Patil, CEO, CIMR. In her inaugural
      address, Dr Patil spoke about how the conference was driven by students , outlined the various initiatives taken
      by CIMR Founder-President, the late Shri Madhukarrao Chaudhari, towards water conservation and management, and
      also emphasized on the need for water management and security.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">After the event was declared open, the keynote speaker, Ajay Popat, President,
      Ion Exchange India Ltd, showed the students a compelling video based on the vision of Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam on
      what the year 2070 would look like if we did not adopt water conservation practices with immediate effect. He took
      a more technical approach and provided us with facts and figures to stress the serious problem of water scarcity
      and its consequences for the socio-economic development of the country. After listing out some of the major
      projects that his company, Ion Exchange India Ltd, had undertaken to increase water security, Mr Popat concluded
      by saying that water was everyone’s business and that we could make a difference only if we came together in the
      cause of water conservation.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Niv Pintow was our international speaker from Israel and owner, Livnat
      Engineering. He focused on the difference between a crisis, a water crisis and a water management crisis. Using
      Israel as an example, he provided us with the various methods implemented towards becoming a water-secure country.
      He emphasized on how trust between the people and the government was crucial, and concluded by stating that people
      would use water conservation techniques once we put a price on water. He was glad to see so many students of
      Chetana’s Institutes of Management and Research present for the international water conference on a Saturday
      morning.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Mr Rajendra Pawar, Secretary (CADA), Govt. of Maharashtra, took up Mr Pintow’s
      point further and explained how Israel did what India was now striving to do. He explained the difference in water
      demand between rural and urban areas, and threw light on the various water conservation initiatives undertaken by
      the state government. Mr Pawar concluded by urging the students to act as ambassadors to spread awareness about
      climate change and the need for water security.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The three speakers were then presented with tokens of appreciation followed by
      a vote of thanks by Dr Hufrish Majra, Faculty of Marketing at CIMR, who summed up the key takeaways from our
      speakers and reminded us that water security was ultimately in our hands.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The conference continued with a panel discussion on Innovative Practices in
      Water Management. The panel – which included Mr Harish Chandar (Director, India tech), Mr Vinay Deodhar (Director,
      Clean tech solutions), Mr Romiel Samuel (Executive Director, Indus Water Institute) and Mr Milind Murudkar (MD,
      Saisanket Enterprises) was moderated by Dr. Sandeep Nemlekar (Associate Professor, CIMR).</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The panel discussion began with Mr Deodhar telling us about how wastewater
      should not be considered a waste and the need for shorter transport routes to reduce water wastage. Mr Chandar
      emphasised on the integration of AI, IoT and Cloud Computing in water management and how technology was the way to
      sustainable water security. Mr Samuel made us realise about the lack of awareness with regard to water
      conservation and the various available career opportunities in the field. Mr Murudkar cited examples of various
      crops and explained how different cultivation techniques impacted water conservation.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Dr Nemlekar then posed questions to the panel.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">On whether copying Israel’s practices was the way to go, Mr Samuel responded by
      saying that although they would benefit India to some extent, there was no single solution and the answer would
      vary based on the problem at hand. They then informed the students regarding the various career opportunities in
      the water sector, following by which the panel was opened to questions from the student-audience.</p>
    <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The students then conducted a research paper presentation in three tracks,
      followed by a valedictory address. The conference elicited participation from academia, industry and government.
