        <p class="textSection2 text-justify"><span class="heading1">International Water Conference – A Water Secure World: A Report</span></p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Chetana’s Institutes of Management and Research hosted a day-long international conference on a water secure world on the campus, on January 18, 2020. The event provided a forum for researchers and practitioners in the field to share ideas and research.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The event was inaugurated by Dr Madhumita Patil, CEO, CIMR. In her inaugural address, Dr Patil spoke about how the conference was driven by students , outlined the various initiatives taken by CIMR Founder-President, the late Shri Madhukarrao Chaudhari, towards water conservation and management, and also emphasized on the need for water management and security.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">After the event was declared open, the keynote speaker, Ajay Popat, President, Ion Exchange India Ltd, showed the students a compelling video based on the vision of Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam on what the year 2070 would look like if we did not adopt water conservation practices with immediate effect. He took a more technical approach and provided us with facts and figures to stress the serious problem of water scarcity and its consequences for the socio-economic development of the country. After listing out some of the major projects that his company, Ion Exchange India Ltd, had undertaken to increase water security, Mr Popat concluded by saying that water was everyone’s business and that we could make a difference only if we came together in the cause of water conservation.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Niv Pintow was our international speaker from Israel and owner, Livnat Engineering. He focused on the difference between a crisis, a water crisis and a water management crisis. Using Israel as an example, he provided us with the various methods implemented towards becoming a water-secure country. He emphasized on how trust between the people and the government was crucial, and concluded by stating that people would use water conservation techniques once we put a price on water. He was glad to see so many students of Chetana’s Institutes of Management and Research present for the international water conference on a Saturday morning.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Mr Rajendra Pawar, Secretary (CADA), Govt. of Maharashtra, took up Mr Pintow’s point further and explained how Israel did what India was now striving to do. He explained the difference in water demand between rural and urban areas, and threw light on the various water conservation initiatives undertaken by the state government. Mr Pawar concluded by urging the students to act as ambassadors to spread awareness about climate change and the need for water security.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The three speakers were then presented with tokens of appreciation followed by a vote of thanks by Dr Hufrish Majra, Faculty of Marketing at CIMR, who summed up the key takeaways from our speakers and reminded us that water security was ultimately in our hands.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The conference continued with a panel discussion on Innovative Practices in Water Management. The panel – which included Mr Harish Chandar (Director, India tech), Mr Vinay Deodhar (Director, Clean tech solutions), Mr Romiel Samuel (Executive Director, Indus Water Institute) and Mr Milind Murudkar (MD, Saisanket Enterprises) was moderated by Dr. Sandeep Nemlekar (Associate Professor, CIMR).</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The panel discussion began with Mr Deodhar telling us about how wastewater should not be considered a waste and the need for shorter transport routes to reduce water wastage. Mr Chandar emphasised on the integration of AI, IoT and Cloud Computing in water management and how technology was the way to sustainable water security. Mr Samuel made us realise about the lack of awareness with regard to water conservation and the various available career opportunities in the field. Mr Murudkar cited examples of various crops and explained how different cultivation techniques impacted water conservation.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Dr Nemlekar then posed questions to the panel.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">On whether copying Israel’s practices was the way to go, Mr Samuel responded by saying that although they would benefit India to some extent, there was no single solution and the answer would vary based on the problem at hand. They then informed the students regarding the various career opportunities in the water sector, following by which the panel was opened to questions from the student-audience.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The students then conducted a research paper presentation in three tracks, followed by a valedictory address. The conference elicited participation from academia, industry and government.</p>

It is important for students to appreciate cultural nuances and gain insights into academics in other countries. This gives them a better understanding of the global marketplace. CIMR Students' interaction with students from leading universities LA- Trobe University, New York State University and Swinburne Australia is a common feature at CIMR. Students from other countries during interaction bring a unique flavor to the campus with graduate degrees in various fields and international work experience which add to the diversity and peer group learning.</p>

        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">In its endeavour to take up social causes, Chetana's Institute of Management and Research (CIMR) in association with Anti-Narcotics Cell, Crime Branch, Mumbai, carried out a Drug Awareness Program on International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, on 26th June, 2022.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">With increasing usage of drugs that has become a matter of serious concern for the government and parents, the team CIMR undertook this task of carrying out awareness on the consumption of drugs. The main objective of the program was to create awareness on the ill effects of Drug Misuse, Symptoms of Drug Abuse and its impact on physical and mental health.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">To spread the message, enthusiastic students of CIMR organised a flash mob and street plays at NCPA, Nariman Point and the Amphitheatre at Carter Road, Bandra. The event attracted attention of the local citizens and created awareness on the effects on consuming drugs and how to contact the Anti-Narcotics Cell, Crime Branch.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The event was organised by the faculty team comprising of Dr. Mahesh Luthia, and CSR Committee members Dr. Athar Qureshi and Dr. Sandeep Nemlekar under the guidance of Dr. Nandita Mishra, Director, CIMR, and Dr. Madhumita Patil, CEO, CIMR.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The street play was very well received by the audience in presence of the Commissioner of Police to underline the importance of the cause. DCP Mr. Datta Nalwade along with his team joined the students in the awareness program. The event was also reported by the media in the local newspaper. The crowd not only participated actively but also joined the students in propagating the awareness to ‘Say No to Drugs and Say Yes to Life!’.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The recording of the street play was shared with students of CIMR to create awareness among them.</p>

        <p class="textSection2 text-justify pt-3 pt-md-4">CIMR in association with New Horizons Child Development Centre had organised an initiative ‘Limit my Screen Time’. The objective of this social initiative was to sensitize the parents, children and the society at large regarding the ill effects of using mobile phones and screens excessively.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Being exposed to screens from a very young age leads to problems such as inattention, sleep disorder, lack of social interaction and psychological inabilities. Hence, as a part of our corporate social responsibility, we tried to spread awareness among parents about the excessive screen time observed amongst young children.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">Students were divided in two teams- The campaign team and the Scientific Research team. The campaign team was responsible for creating awareness. In a highly creative manner, they enacted a role-play and displayed informative posters at prominent locations in malls during January 2020. The research team tried to understand the relationship of screen time and its impact on brain development as well as social communication skills of children. During their research, they also recorded the strategy used by other countries to minimize the screen time of children.</p>
        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">On 14th November 2019 as part of the Children’s Day Celebration, a poster-making competition was held as part of the ‘LimitMyScreen’ campaign. Later various events such as walkathons and street plays were organized to create awareness of the impact of excess usage of screen by children in the age group of zero to three. The campaigns received a very positive response from different stakeholders.</p>
