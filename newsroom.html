        <p class="textSection2 text-justify">The main annual events of the Institute are Elixir, Arthanaad, Vipanan and
            HROPSYS. These programs are basically speeches of guest speakers from the industry in the fields of general
            management, finance, marketing, human resources, operations and systems respectively. The above programs are
            organised by the student committees. We know that the main functions of management are planning, organising,
            leading, controlling, coordination and team work. Thus when students organize these programs they get hands
            on experience and real exposure to managing a live project (event). The planning and preparation for these
            programs starts about 3 months in advance. The decision making skills, communication skills, quality of
            work, reliability and ethical behaviour of the students are honed at various stages as they plan and execute
            the event. They decide on the vision, objectives, goals and theme of the program. The student committees
            clearly define different tasks that need to be performed. Grouping these tasks into departments and thus
            designing a type of organisation structure with departmentalisation and reporting clarity, (organising) is
            done by the students. Further, taking initiatives, leading the teams, motivating team members, delegating
            authority, communicating goals and plans to team members, decision making, honesty and transparency in
            handling budgets, problem solving, coming up with innovative ideas for smooth functioning of the show is
            done by the students. As the students go through the drill of organising the events, managing all the
            complex activities involved in it, they emerge as young managers who are more skilled and more ready for the
            corporate role</p>
