    <h2 class="pgdm_title">SUMMER PLACEMENT</h2>
    <p class="InnerText">SIP- Summer placement (Summer internship programme, i.e., now popularly known as SIP), is an integral part of the academic curriculum of PGDM. For the successful completion of the programme, the students are required to complete the SIP.</p>

        <p class="InnerText"></p>After completion of the 1st year of the programme, i.e., after the 2nd semester and before the commencement of the second year of the programme, the students are required to work with an organisation for hands on experience. The duration of the SIP is eight to ten weeks. In some cases this period may be a little longer.</p>
        
        <p class="InnerText"></p>SIP aims at widening the student's perspective by providing an exposure to real life organisational and environmental situations. This will enable the students to explore an industry/organisation, build a relationship with a prospective employer, or simply hone their skills in a familiar field. SIP also provides invaluable knowledge and networking experience to the students. During the internship, the student has the chance to put whatever he/she learned in the 1st year of PGDM into practice while working on a business plan or trying out a new industry, job function or organisation. The organisation, in turn, benefits from the objective and unbiased perspective the student provides based on concepts and skills imbibed in the first year at the institute.</p>
        
        <p class="InnerText"> Some ideal projects for summer internships can be in the areas of strategy formulation, business process reengineering, MIS, ERP implementation, retail banking, industry analysis, new product launches, sales and distribution, market research and advertising, etc., among others. However, this is not an exhaustive list of areas but can be varied to suit the requirements of the organisations where the student has to undergo internship. In some cases, even field work can also become an integral part of SIP. An additional benefit that organisations may derive is the unique opportunity to evaluate the student from a long-term perspective. Thus the SIP can become a gateway for final placement of the student.</p>
        
            <p class="InnerText">  The student should ensure that the data and other information used in the study are obtained with the permission of the organization concerned. The students should also behave ethically and honestly with the organisation.</p>

        <p class="InnerText">  During the 8 hours session, Dr. Chirag Shah gave a new perspective toward the derivatives as a financial instrument. He elaborated on the use of derivatives as a risk management instrument. At the same time he emphasised on the right use of leverage for wealth creation.</p>
