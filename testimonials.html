                                                @Chetana's. Well thought out, designed & planned program. Highly
                                                experienced professors and guest faculty. Many practical examples, case
                                                studies, quiz and practical hands-on activities. All staff are very
                                                professional. This programme has given me new directions to think on how
                                                to execute project management activities in Banking more effectively and
                                                efficiently. Normally, as project managers, we plan and execute projects
                                                but often we face problems related to budget overshoot, delayed
                                                timeline, scope creep. But, after participating in the PGDM prep
                                                programme @Chetana's, I learnt many methods/tools/techniques by which we
                                                can have control over budget, time & scope.</p>

                                                course was very comprehensively designed, and the faculties are
                                                exceptional. Case studies, role-plays, and presentations are key
                                                pointers in evaluating individuals. I have learned time management, team
                                                skills, and leadership skills and have also been able to advance these
                                                skills to an augmented level. The institute organizes various guest
                                                lectures, conferences, and case conclaves to give a hands-on experience
                                                to its students. In this program, I gained tremendous knowledge about
                                                varied facets of business. The course offered a wide range of important
                                                subjects like Accounting to Financial Analysis, Business strategy to
                                                Business analysis, and Marketing research & analytics, and many more.
                                                The coursework always provides the students every chance to build a
                                                robust skill set applicable to many business career paths. The
                                                professors always give understanding of how the concepts we are learning
                                                in class are being applied in the business world. These connections made
                                                us confident that we are learning practical skills which we will use in
                                                our further business career. The PGDM program at Chetana's has given me
                                                invaluable experience working through real-life business problems. I
                                                would definitely recommend the PGDM program at Chetana's because it’s a
                                                good value for anyone who wants to succeed in management and

                                                of Management and Research has been a wonderful journey. While perusing
                                                my PGDM course at the Institute, I was surrounded by excellent faculty

                                                wasn’t just about giving presentations. There were live case studies
                                                which were discussed and we were given the opportunity to visit the

                                                stand out in this competitive world. PGDM Systems included challenging
                                                courses that applied business decisions to case studies and coursework
                                                in areas of emerging technological trends. With vast experience,
                                                intellect and knowledge of the industry, the professors were able to
                                                provide a practical perspective to the subject. And, having great
                                                opportunities for Summer as well as Off-Summer internships allowed me to
